# big-data-processes
This sketch file includes various big data processes and flows. Files will need layer cleanup/organization as it becomes maintained over time. If Sketch file needs to be converted to PSD, import PDF into Illustrator and export as PSD. Once PSD is available open up in Photoshop and erase clipping masks as needed to reveal specific layers. This is the only workaround when needing PSDs and converting from Sketch files without a rebuild in Photoshop.
